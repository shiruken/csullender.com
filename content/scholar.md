Because of anti-scraping protections implemented by Google, the [Scholar Plotr tool]({{< relref "posts/google-scholar-visualization" >}}) no longer reliably functions and has been deprecated. A similar visualization can be obtained using the [Dimensions](https://app.dimensions.ai/) platform, although the results are more limited and the underlying data is not made available.

Check out my [other coding projects](/coding).
