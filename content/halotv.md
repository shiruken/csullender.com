I used to help run a website back in the day called HaloTV where we hosted tons of Halo videos. There were montages, many of the original Halo machinima videos (Red vs. Blue, Codex, Fire Team Charlie, etc.), and all sorts of trick videos. It was fun times.

I've uploaded the entire ~10GB of videos to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a3hFMZLoUGGxP41E3yzpmTPZQCcoboDR?usp=sharing) to share (also embedded below).

Happy reminiscing Reclaimer!
