The [Red Bull Grand Prix of the Americas](http://www.motogp.com/en/events/Americas/2014) was this past weekend at the [Circuit of the Americas](http://circuitoftheamericas.com/) in Austin, TX. The event spans three days with practice and qualifiers occurring on Saturday and the races for the three classes (MotoGP, Moto2, and Moto3) occurring on Sunday. I attended both days of weekend events and had a great time watching beastly motorcycles roar past [Turn 1](https://www.google.com/maps/@30.1300364,-97.6369164,252m/data=!3m1!1e3).
