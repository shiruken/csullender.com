I spent my entire Saturday helping out at [Explore UT](http://www.utexas.edu/events/exploreut/) as part of a Biomedical Optics Graduate Organization (BOGO) outreach event. We held three forty-minute-long sessions with about thirty kids (8-11 years old) and taught them about optics and the properties of light. Thanks to some incredible funding from our backing organizations ([OSA](http://www.osa.org/) and [SPIE](http://spie.org/)), we were able to provide the kids with numerous hands-on, take-home demos including polarizers, diffraction gratings, UV color-changing beads, and a telescope. It was great interacting with kids concerning topics that are much more tangible than molecule engineering, which has always been a downside to my previous research experiences. There's just something incredibly satisfying about seeing their eyes light up when they play around with these simple experiments. I think this one picture summarizes everything quite nicely.
