Another crazy [SXSW](http://sxsw.com/) has come and gone in Austin, TX, and I'm completely exhausted. Unlike the past two years where most of my participation was during the Music portion of the festival, I explored extensively during Interactive (i.e. earlier). The biggest events I attended were the Dropbox party and the multi-day Rachael Ray Feedback House Party. The first was at a brand new bar on Rainey Street called [Container Bar](http://austincontainerbar.com/) and featured live music from Wild Cub (they're gonna blow up). The second was at an event space on East Cesar Chavez called [Chick Ranch](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Chick-Ranch-Austin/697801683571177) and featured tons of live bands and BBQ from a Chicago restaurant called [Lillies](http://www.lilliesq.com/). I managed to snag invites to both events for myself and a ton of my friends through some Twitter magic. Besides those, I walked around to a ton of the open venues all across downtown Austin to catch music and eat/drink free stuff.

As usual, I was carrying my [Fitbit One](https://www.fitbit.com/one) the entire time in order to track the craziness that is SXSW. With public transit and driving basically useless around the downtown area, walking (and biking) are really the only viable options. This year I managed to accrue 162,434 steps (78.35 miles) between March 6 - 15. Interestingly enough, that total exceeds last year's tally by only 29 steps. I've put together some graphs below depicting my daily step count and distance for each day of the festival this year.
