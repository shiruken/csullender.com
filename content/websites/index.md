# Reddit r/science (2015 - Current)

[reddit.com/r/science](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/ "Visit the r/science subreddit")

The r/science community on Reddit is the largest science discussion platform on the internet with over 23 million subscribers and tens of millions of monthly pageviews. As a lead moderator of this subreddit, I help establish community policy and guide scientific discourse. Our [Ask Me Anything](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/search?q=flair%3AAMA&sort=top&restrict_sr=on&t=all) and [Science Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/search?q=flair:Discussion&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) series have hosted hundreds of scientists, engineers, doctors, and other experts to discuss their current work with a more general audience. Some of our most popular guests have included [Stephen Hawking](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3nyn5i/science_ama_series_stephen_hawking_ama_answers/), [George Church](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/4fbcyv/science_ama_series_im_george_church_professor_at/), [Jennifer Doudna](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/7r9pgw/hi_were_here_to_talk_about_all_things_crispr_and/), and numerous members of [NASA](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/search/?q=flair%3ANASA&restrict_sr=1&sort=top), ESA, [NOAA](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/search/?q=flair%3ANOAA&restrict_sr=1&sort=top), and NIH.

Behind the scenes, I implemented a comprehensive tracking system using the Reddit API in order to better understand the dynamics and reach of our content, optimize automated moderation practices, and to guide future decision making for the subreddit. I also designed the current branding and style used by the desktop website.

# Functional Optical Imaging Laboratory (2014 - Current)

[foil.bme.utexas.edu](https://foil.bme.utexas.edu/)

I helped develop and currently maintain the website for my academic research lab at the University of Texas at Austin. The website was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/) module for the design and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

# Google+ 'Science GIFs' Collection (2015 - 2018)

[~~https://plus.google.com/collection/A2NSc~~](https://plus.google.com/collection/A2NSc "View the Science GIFs collection on Google+")

[https://sciencegifs.csullender.com/](https://sciencegifs.csullender.com/ "View archive of the content from the Science GIFs collection")

I created and maintained the 'Science GIFs' collection on Google+. It was one of the largest and most active science-focused collections on the social network and [garnered over 320,000 followers]({{< relref "three-years-of-science-gifs-on-google" >}} "View 'Three Years of 'Science GIFs' on Google+' blog entry") prior to the shuttering of the Google+ platform. The collection featured weekly posts explaining phenomena depicted in short animated GIFs gathered from various sources across the internet. The success of this collection resulted in an invitation to the Google+ Create program, which highlighted quality content on the platform.

An [archive](https://sciencegifs.csullender.com/) of the Science GIFs collection was created using Python to [parse](https://github.com/shiruken/sciencegifs/blob/master/parseGooglePlus.py) Google Takeout JSON into [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-formatted Markdown. The repository containing nearly 4GB of GIFs is [fully hosted on GitHub Pages](https://github.com/shiruken/sciencegifs) and heavily cached using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).


# Biomedical Optics Graduate Organization (2012 - 2015)

~~studentorgs.utexas.edu/bogo~~

I designed, developed, and maintained the website for the Biomedical Optics Graduate Organization (BOGO) at the University of Texas at Austin. The website was a combination of PHP and HTML and provided basic information about the student organization such as new, upcoming events, and academic resources. The website was discontinued alongside the university's hosting services in 2015.
