It claimed the #1 spot on r/all within an hour and remained there for over 5 hours. <strong>By time it fell out of the top 25, it had been on the frontpage for 9 hours and 40 minutes</strong>.</p><p><img src=Rank.png alt="Submission Ranking Chart"></p><p>The post garnered over <strong>195,000 karma</strong>, making it the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/top/?t=all" class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener><strong>highest-scoring submission of all time on r/science</strong></a> and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/top/?t=all" class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener><strong>20th highest-ranked post of all time on Reddit</strong></a>. Over 940,000 people viewed the post and it drove an enormous increase in traffic to the subreddit (2.0M pageviews, 1.3M uniques). Those numbers represent 32% of all unique visitors and 12% of all pageviews during the entire month of March.</p><p><img src=SubredditTraffic.png alt="Daily Subreddit Traffic"></p><p>r/science was not the only subreddit paying tribute to Hawking, the entire &ldquo;front page of the internet&rdquo; was covered with news of his death. Comment after comment described his influence on people&rsquo;s lives. He was an inspiration for an entire generation of physicists and scientists. He was an inspiration for those suffering from debilitating motor neuron diseases. And he was an inspiration to everyday people who, because of his efforts, were given the opportunity to wonder about the Universe. And for a brief moment, the entire Reddit community was united in remembering his legacy.</p><blockquote><p>Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the Universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don&rsquo;t just give up.</p><p>Stephen Hawking (January 8, 2012)</p></blockquote></div><footer><div id=disqus_thread></div><script>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//csullender.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}(),document.addEventListener("themeChanged",function(){document.readyState=="complete"&&DISQUS.reset({reload:!0,config:disqus_config})})</script></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
