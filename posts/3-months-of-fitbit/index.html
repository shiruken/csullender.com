It&rsquo;s been just over three months since I started tracking my daily steps and most of my sleep. While I haven&rsquo;t started running yet (I promise I&rsquo;ll start eventually), it&rsquo;s been fascinating to see my walking activity tracked throughout the day. One of my biggest complaints about Fitbit&rsquo;s services is that they make you pay to access in-depth information about your activity. I think that it&rsquo;s absolutely ludicrous to charge $49.99 a year to see the full extent of your data. With that said, they do offer an API for third-party development with access to the raw data (steps, distance, etc.) so I used this to <a href=http://quantifiedself.com/2013/02/how-to-download-fitbit-data-using-google-spreadsheets/>automatically pull</a> my daily activity into a Google Drive spreadsheet for easy access and analysis. Using this data, I generate my <a href=http://www.csullender.com/health/>&ldquo;health tracking&rdquo; page</a> featuring several charts of my ongoing Fitbit activity. The remainder of this post presents a summary of my Fitbit activity over the past 90 days since I got the One.</p><p><img src=Daily-Steps.png alt="Daily Steps"></p><p>The graph above depicts my daily step count for the past 90 days. The large increase in steps around Day 70 occurs during SXSW 2013 where I frequently walked over twice the 10,000 step daily goal. During this period, <strong>I averaged 8,771 steps per day (6.8 miles)</strong> with a maximum of 22,387 steps (17.4 miles) and a minimum of 1,249 steps (0.9 miles). <strong>In total I took 798,121 steps for a total of 619.4 miles.</strong> As far as I can tell, the pedometer is extremely reliable at counting steps and correctly ignoring movements that might be interpreted as a step. The stair-climbing count is a little less reliable and always seems to be much higher than I would have expected. The graphs below shows weekly averages for steps and distance. Once again, the massive spike in steps is the result of SXSW where I walked almost 100 miles over the course of the week.</p><p><img src=Weekly.png alt=Weekly></p><p>The pie chart below shows my average activity breakdown throughout the course of a day. As I mentioned earlier, my status as a graduate student often results in my being stationary for (unhealthily/frustratingly) long periods of time. This is clearly seen in my abysmal activity report where my walks to/from the bus stop are the only source of &ldquo;Very&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fairly&rdquo; active ratings. A possible confounding factor is how exactly Fitbit counts time when in sleep tracking mode. If it is tracked as &ldquo;sedentary,&rdquo; then this graph is misleading since about 7-8hrs of sleep are erroneously being included when it should only show activity whilst awake</p><p><img src=Daily-Activity.png alt="Daily Activity"></p><p>And finally, what analytics report would be complete without some attempt at making an infographic? So here&rsquo;s a summary one that compiles some of the numbers reported above (and demonstrates my mediocre Illustrator skills). I&rsquo;ve been quite happy with my Fitbit and once I actually start running again, it&rsquo;ll be even more useful for tracking activity in lieu of lugging around my smartphone while running. I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;ve made any conscious changes to my everyday activity since getting the One, but I definitely feel encouraged to walk more by knowing exactly how far I&rsquo;ve walked each day. If that is enough to motivate/game-ify more physical activity from a user, then I think Fitbit has succeeded in their goal.</p><p><img src=Infographic.png alt=Infographic></p><p>There are also several websites that can make infographics from your account data automatically. This one called <a href=http://notch.me/p/3VLnteBvoGwwT6lCBRqmSc>Kodachrome</a> produces a really cool radar plot of the monthly activity.</p><p><img src=Kodachrome.jpg alt=Kodachrome></p></div><footer><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//csullender.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
