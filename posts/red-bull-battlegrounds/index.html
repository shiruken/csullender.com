A 16-player invitational hosted by Day[9], DJwheat, Husky, and Rob Simpson, the event was a resounding success for a non-major-league (<a href=http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/>MLG</a> or <a href=http://www.ign.com/ipl>IPL</a>) live event. I decided to only attend the second day (Sunday) of the tournament since the first day featured a round-robin tournament in which an absolute deluge of games were played. Day 2 took the top 8 players from the previous day and seeded them into a single-elimination bracket to fight for over $40k in prize money.</p><p><img src=quarterfinals_1.jpg alt="Quarterfinals - TaeJa vs. Bomber"></p><p>I had opted to buy the cheapest $10 balcony seats since I knew the Moody Theater was small enough to see all the action with ease. I was extremely lucky to have my ticket upgraded to a VIP pass by the <a href=http://studentorgs.utexas.edu/tespa/>Texas eSports Association</a> (TeSPA) and <a href=https://twitter.com/#!/redbullgaming>Red Bull Gaming</a>. I gained full access to the VIP suits, the &ldquo;best&rdquo; seating in the venue, and free drinks (Red Bull was obviously an option). So rather than having to drop money for expensive food, I got to sit around enjoying all the action. It was quite awesome to finally see these world-class players in person rather than from the confines of my apartment on a livestream. The atmosphere of live competitions, regardless of the event, is always superior to watching from afar. It&rsquo;s absolutely incredible to watch the entire audience erupt into celebration as a competitor emerges victorious with hands held high. Combined with the great production of the Red Bull team and the awesome acoustics of the venue, Battlegrounds was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon.
