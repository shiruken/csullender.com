I needed an easy way to automatically transfer data from my collection computer to the lab server for storage and to my office computer for post-processing. While I have much more free storage than your average non-paying Dropbox user, I needed to regularly transfer tens of gigabytes of files without any need of uploading to the Internet/cloud. BitTorrent Sync seemed to fulfill that need almost perfectly and was vastly easier than constantly running rsync commands.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Facebook Photo Compression</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/facebook-photo-compression/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2015 23:11:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/facebook-photo-compression/</guid><description>&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZosEbRLbNQzLpnKIkEdrPv7lOy9C27hHQ+Xp8a4MxAQ=" crossorigin="anonymous">&lt;/script>

&lt;p>A couple weeks ago there was a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android/comments/3mjxz8/tip_if_uploading_images_to_facebook_use/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit post on /r/Android&lt;/a> recommending Facebook users upload photos via the &lt;a href="http://m.facebook.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile website&lt;/a> rather than the official Android Facebook app. The app reportedly compressed an original 8MP (4.5MB) photo to only 0.6MP (100kB) whereas the mobile website uploaded at 3MP (440kB). For a typical 4:3 ratio photograph, 0.6MP works out to neither dimension having more than 1000 pixels! Viewers on almost all current smartphones and tablets would be looking at an image smaller than their screen size. For a social network so heavily driven by photographs, you would think Facebook would do a better job maintaining some modicum of image quality. Most users probably have no idea their images are being so heavily degraded by uploading via the app. This blog examines the varying quality of Facebook image uploads in an attempt to identify the best option if you must upload to Facebook.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SXSW 2015</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/sxsw-2015/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2015 02:26:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/sxsw-2015/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another year, another South By, another week of extensive walking and partaking in free parties and concerts.

I ran a handful of different benchmarks under both OS X and Windows boots to see what the &lt;a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819117372" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel Core i5-4690K&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814487076" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVGA GeForce GTX 970 SC&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820147360" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung 850 Pro&lt;/a> could do.

All tests were conducted 5 times and averaged together on OS X 10.10.1 Yosemite with no overclocking. While the i5-2500K (3.3GHz) in my original Hackintosh had similar performance to the i7-2720QM (2.2GHz) in the MacBook Pro, the i5-4690K (3.5GHz) offers all-around better performance. &lt;strong>Based on overall Geekbench scores, the Hackintosh v2.0 system is roughly 33% better than its predecessor.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Oscar Party 8.0</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/oscar-party-8/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Mar 2015 03:47:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/oscar-party-8/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another year, &lt;a href="https://csullender.com/posts/oscarmadness/" title="#OscarMadness" >another Oscar Party&lt;/a>.

After considerable waffling on the exact components to get, I finally settled on an relatively high-end build largely based on the &lt;a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/building-customac-buyers-guide-december-2014.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December CustoMac Buyer&amp;rsquo;s Guide&lt;/a> that reused a few components from my original Hackintosh (&lt;a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811139008" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817371031" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">power supply&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231429" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memory&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The most difficult decision by far concerned the graphics card since the current generation &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/specs/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mac Pro&lt;/a> uses a custom AMD GPU whereas most Hackintosh guides recommend NVIDIA cards. Since there are currently no Macs with any of these NVIDIA cards, there is no native support for them in OS X. This obviously makes using them a little more difficult compared to my first build which basically worked out-of-box. After &lt;a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/graphics/143435-nvidia-releases-alternate-graphics-drivers-10-10-0-343-01-01-maxwell-geforce-gtx-970-980-support.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extensive research&lt;/a>, I decided on the &lt;a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814487076" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce GTX 970&lt;/a> since recently released &lt;a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/graphics/155506-nvidia-releases-alternate-graphics-drivers-10-10-2-343-02-02-a.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alternate drivers from NVIDIA&lt;/a> made the card viable on OS X 10.10 Yosemite without too much trouble.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google Scholar Visualization</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/google-scholar-visualization/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2015 16:59:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/google-scholar-visualization/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the most common images I see during science presentations is the frequency of publications within a particular field over time.

The app tracks every trip and assigns a &amp;ldquo;Driving Score&amp;rdquo; based on driving behavior to encourage &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; driving habits. Currently the only way to access the data is &lt;a href="https://ifttt.com/dash" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via an IFTTT channel&lt;/a> that logs each trip to a line of a Google Spreadsheet. The developer is working on an &lt;a href="https://dash.by/developers" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">API (aptly named Chassis)&lt;/a> that will hopefully make access to the data even easier in the coming future. In the meantime, I just used the IFTTT spreadsheet output to assemble some stats and charts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automatic Android Location Mode Toggling 2.0</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/automatic-android-location-mode-toggling/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2014 16:14:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/automatic-android-location-mode-toggling/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few months ago I had &lt;a href="https://csullender.com/posts/automatic-high-accuracy-android-location/" title="Automatically Toggle &amp;#39;High Accuracy&amp;#39; Location Mode on Android" >a blog post&lt;/a> about automatically toggling Android Location Mode on my smartphone between &lt;code>High Accuracy&lt;/code> and &lt;code>Battery Saving&lt;/code> when using certain apps. Using the super-app &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tasker&lt;/a> and a 3rd-party plugin called &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intangibleobject.securesettings.plugin" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secure Settings&lt;/a> I was able to swap the Location Mode of my Nexus 5 between the two modes. However, this was a poor solution since closing an app would result in disabling GPS access, which was undesirable if navigation was currently active. Furthermore, closing an app and returning to it would result in deactivation regardless of the timing. Despite numerous suggestions in the comments, none of them provided a viable answer. Since then, I purchased a &lt;a href="http://amzn.com/B005NLQAHS" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bluetooth OBD&lt;/a> (On-Board Diagnostic) tool to use with the very cool app &lt;a href="https://dash.by/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dash&lt;/a>. This device remains on at all times and the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dashlabs.dash.android&amp;amp;hl=en" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dash app&lt;/a> is set to automatically connect whenever in range. This automatic connection via Bluetooth is what makes the following modifications to my automatic Location Mode toggling task possible. In practice, any automatically-connecting Bluetooth device in your car (or part of your car) could allow you to use this technique. &lt;strong>As before, you will need root access for Secure Settings to properly function.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MotoGP ATX 2014</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/motogp-atx-2014/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2014 01:28:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/motogp-atx-2014/</guid><description>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://www.motogp.com/en/events/Americas/2014" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Bull Grand Prix of the Americas&lt;/a> was this past weekend at the &lt;a href="http://circuitoftheamericas.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Circuit of the Americas&lt;/a> in Austin, TX.

The biggest events I attended were the Dropbox party and the multi-day Rachael Ray Feedback House Party. The first was at a brand new bar on Rainey Street called &lt;a href="http://austincontainerbar.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Container Bar&lt;/a> and featured live music from Wild Cub (they&amp;rsquo;re gonna blow up).

I managed to snag invites to both events for myself and a ton of my friends through some Twitter magic.

&lt;p>One of Android&amp;rsquo;s most innovative features is &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/landing/now/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Now&lt;/a>, a service that attempts to provide relevant information to the user based on location and time. Unfortunately, in order to utilize the location-based service, your smartphone must provide location information to Google at expense of battery life. When Android 4.4 &amp;ldquo;Kitkat&amp;rdquo; was released in late October, the location settings were updated to include three different modes: High accuracy, battery saving, and device only. The &amp;lsquo;high accuracy&amp;rsquo; mode utilizes GPS, Wi-Fi, and mobile networks to determine location, &amp;lsquo;battery saving&amp;rsquo; only uses Wi-Fi and mobile networks, and &amp;lsquo;device only&amp;rsquo; relies exclusively on GPS.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quickstart Dogecoin blockchain sync with bootstrap.dat</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/quickstart-dogecoin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2014 01:00:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/quickstart-dogecoin/</guid><description>&lt;p>While &lt;a href="http://bitcoin.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin&lt;/a> is the undisputed leader of the cryptocurrency world, a meme-based alternative called &lt;a href="http://dogecoin.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dogecoin&lt;/a> has gained steam over the past month. Sporting the comical Shiba Inu dog character from the &amp;ldquo;doge&amp;rdquo; meme, this altcoin gained significant media coverage recently after &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/20/jamaican-bobsled-team-raises-dogecoin-winter-olympics" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helping raise $30,000 for the Jamaican bobsled team&lt;/a> for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Promoters of this cryptocurrency have been extremely vocal about the carefree attitude surrounding Dogecoin and actively encourage giving freely to others (tipping) in order to raise awareness. The userbase has exploded since its December 6, 2013, introduction with over 33 billion Dogecoin mined to date. The growing online presence and transaction volume have caused the Dogecoin &lt;a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain&lt;/a> to swell to over 2GB in size. The &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1upa5y/bounty_15_million_doge_for_the_first_person_to/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lack of a thin client&lt;/a> means that new users must download and verify the entire blockchain before they can participate.

The desktop wallet software offers client-side encryption and eliminates the need to trust a third party to secure your assets. The downsides of the desktop client are the extremely slow initial sync and need to constantly resync with the blockchain network. Fortunately there&amp;rsquo;s a trick that can help speed up the initial blockchain download by loading the blockchain from a local file rather than the network.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Get the Price of Bitcoin with Google Now</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/google-now-bitcoin-price/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2014 00:31:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/google-now-bitcoin-price/</guid><description>&lt;p>The digital currency &lt;a href="http://bitcoin.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin&lt;/a> has &lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/charts/market-cap" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grown increasingly popular&lt;/a> in &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=bitcoin&amp;amp;date=1%2F2012%2025m&amp;amp;cmpt=q" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent months&lt;/a> as &lt;a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more and more businesses have begun accepting&lt;/a> the peer-to-peer cryptocurrency.

It&amp;rsquo;s been just over three months since I started tracking my daily steps and most of my sleep. While I haven&amp;rsquo;t started running yet (I promise I&amp;rsquo;ll start eventually), it&amp;rsquo;s been fascinating to see my walking activity tracked throughout the day. One of my biggest complaints about Fitbit&amp;rsquo;s services is that they make you pay to access in-depth information about your activity. I think that it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely ludicrous to charge $49.99 a year to see the full extent of your data. With that said, they do offer an API for third-party development with access to the raw data (steps, distance, etc.) so I used this to &lt;a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2013/02/how-to-download-fitbit-data-using-google-spreadsheets/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automatically pull&lt;/a> my daily activity into a Google Drive spreadsheet for easy access and analysis.

Unfortunately, because Twitter does not offer the entire tweeting history via the website or this XML feed, I was missing well over a year of data. Combined with problems accessing this feed, I would regularly lose my entire (local) cache of my Twitter feed and have to spend a lot of time fixing everything.

Unfortunately, the original device that I received had some problems with the ear-piece, resulting in a very noticeable static hissing noise during calls and even when the phone wasn&amp;rsquo;t in use. I decided to RMA the defective device to Google in exchange for a replacement. After several weeks of waiting, I finally got my hands on my Rev. 11 Google Nexus 4 (original was Rev. 10) and prepared to transfer over to the new phone. I opted to use a standard &lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/wiki/NANDroid" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nandroid backup&lt;/a> of the original device&amp;rsquo;s content in order to transfer everything to the new device (essentially duplicating the content). Unfortunately, I did not pay attention to the &lt;a href="http://support.google.com/wallet/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=2478688" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommended process of transferring Google Wallet&lt;/a> to this new device, which suggests reseting the original device&amp;rsquo;s Wallet application prior to the transition. This is necessary so that the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/wallet/faq.html#security-and-privacy-in-store" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secure Element&lt;/a> created on the device by Google Wallet isn&amp;rsquo;t accidentally transferred to the new device. This secure element can only be accessed by a SINGLE instance of Google Wallet, so if it is transferred to a new phone or even restored to a new ROM on the same device, it can result in Wallet completely losing functionality. Because I failed to reset the Google Wallet app, which removes the secure element, prior to performing the nandroid backup, I inadvertently transferred the secure element and the linked Google Wallet app to the new phone. Unfortunately, this resulted in the breaking of Google Wallet on my RMA Nexus 4 device.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Keeping your Papers Library Synced</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/papers-sync/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2012 00:32:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/papers-sync/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a graduate student, one of the most important tools I use practically every single day is a citation and bibliography reference manager.

Initially a Mac-only client, Papers seemed like a native extension of the OS X environment, akin to that of iTunes or iPhoto. With the ability to search online databases, import articles into a &amp;ldquo;library&amp;rdquo; for organization, and cite papers and assemble bibliographies, Papers does everything I needed and wanted from a reference management program.

I rarely needed access to the contents of my Bootcamp installation so I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be nice to prevent the partition from mounting at all on the Mac side of things. There&amp;rsquo;s a relatively easy way to achieve this using just a little bit of command line fiddling. The only thing you need is administrative rights on the computer. The first thing we need to know is the Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) of the Bootcamp partition that you want to prevent from automatically mounting. Open up the &lt;strong>Disk Utility&lt;/strong> application located in the Utilities folder of your Application folder. Locate the desired partition in the list on the left as shown below. In my case, the partition is called &amp;ldquo;Windows&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Website Crafting for BOGO</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/website-crafting-for-bogo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Oct 2012 03:36:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/website-crafting-for-bogo/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the student groups I&amp;rsquo;m involved in at the University of Texas is the &lt;a href="http://studentorgs.engr.utexas.edu/bogo" title="BOGO Website" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biomedical Optics Graduate Organization&lt;/a> (BOGO).

I spent a few hours throwing together the new design and making it as &lt;em>easy&lt;/em> as possible for future updating of content. Fortunately PHP is available so some of the more frustrating things to update (i.e. the list of members displayed in a table) can be automatically generated from a list of the users. I&amp;rsquo;ve also opted to use Google Calendar and Google Drive to provide functionality on the website in the form of our future events list and contact form.

While developers will scramble to get their apps ready for the sweeping changes oft accompanied by an upgrade to an operating system, it is inevitable that bugs/quirks/errors will surface. As an engineering graduate student, one of the programs I use quite frequently is &lt;a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MATLAB&lt;/a>, which is built upon the X11 window system for the Apple OS environment. In the latest update to OS X, &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5293" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple decided to remove X11&lt;/a> in favor of an open-source development called XQuartz. What this means is that if you upgrade to Mountain Lion, MATLAB cannot run because X11 is no longer included in the operating system. While I&amp;rsquo;m sure many will complain about Apple&amp;rsquo;s apparent lack of support for one of the most commonly used technical programs, they did not truly abandon X11. Rather, they have provided development support to the &lt;a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XQuartz project&lt;/a> which is effectively an updated version of X11 which was first included in Mac OS X 10.5.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Upgrading to Mountain Lion</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/upgrading-to-mountain-lion/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jul 2012 19:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/upgrading-to-mountain-lion/</guid><description>&lt;p>The release of the latest Apple computer operating system &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OS X 10.8 &amp;lsquo;Mountain Lion&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a> has been a &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/30/apple-reports-three-million-mountain-lion-downloads-in-four-days/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resounding success&lt;/a> with over 3 million copies sold in less than four days.

After installing the $20 update onto my laptop, I finally decided to give it a whirl on &lt;a href="http://www.csullender.com/blog/2012/02/12/the-hackintosh/" title="The Hackintosh" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my Hackintosh.&lt;/a> I used the &lt;a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/61-unibeast-1-5-install-os-x-mountain-lion-any-supported-intel-based-pc.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unibeast&lt;/a> tool from the aforementioned &lt;a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/home.php" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TonyMacx86&lt;/a> community to create a bootable flash drive with the Mountain Lion installer. A typical installation would then simply require booting off the flash drive, selecting the installation drive, and then enjoying the new OS. Unfortunately, my graphics card (ATI Radeon HD 6870) has had issues with the installation process and requires a few extra steps to get everything working. Without these additional modifications, the installer hangs at the launch screen indefinitely. This fix should work for any ATI Radeon 6XXX card but I have only tried it on the 6870.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Darkness over the Dark Knight</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/the-darkness-over-the-dark-knight/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jul 2012 23:17:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/the-darkness-over-the-dark-knight/</guid><description>&lt;p>As I&amp;rsquo;m sure everyone online already knows, &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/20/us/colorado-theater-shooting/index.html?hpt=hp_t1" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tragedy struck Aurora, Colorado&lt;/a> early on Friday morning at a midnight showing of Christopher Nolan&amp;rsquo;s final installment in the Batman franchise.

As I mentioned in an &lt;a href="https://csullender.com/posts/the-qualifying-exam-part-i/" title="The Qualifying Exam: Part I" >earlier blog post&lt;/a>, the qualifying exam consists of two parts: a written response and an oral exam with a faculty committee. The written part was extremely straightforward and really just required the reading of background papers to adequately answer the questions. More than anything it just served as a starting point for preparing for the oral examination, which is much more open-ended and difficult to predict. All we were told were the time and place of the exam and the number of faculty members that would comprise the committee. There were four in total with two from my research area (Imaging and Instrumentation) and one from each of the other two research areas. Going into the meeting, that was literally the extent of my knowledge concerning the exam, which leaves the mind quite free to imagine horrible, horrible outcomes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Red Bull Battlegrounds</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/red-bull-battlegrounds/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2012 20:32:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/red-bull-battlegrounds/</guid><description>&lt;p>This past weekend saw the first major competitive video-gaming event take place in Austin, TX as the &lt;a href="http://www.redbullusa.com/cs/Satellite/en_US/Red-Bull-LAN/001243017356310" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Bull Battlegrounds&lt;/a> took over the &lt;a href="http://acl-live.com/venue" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moody Theater&lt;/a> for two days of StarCraft 2 action.

While many people find Anthony Gonzalez&amp;rsquo;s heavily shoegaze-influenced music somewhat boring (excluding that one track that everyone knows from &lt;em>Hurry Up, We&amp;rsquo;re Dreaming&lt;/em>), their live performances are anything but that. From the perfectly implemented light show to the random electronic dance jam sessions in the middle of their more upbeat songs, M83 is a blast to see in concert. Even though there were people at the concert who only wanted to hear &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aZFcosBTaQ" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Midnight City&lt;/a>,&amp;rdquo; there is no denying that the rest of the show was just as energetic.

Both exams are based off a single research paper, selected by the student depending on their research technical area (I fall within Technical Area #1 - Biomedical Imaging and Instrumentation). Later today I will be given the choice of two different papers to choose from. I will then have to answer five questions regarding the content of the paper, which is due in a week. At some point in the next month I will go before a four-person committee made up of faculty members from each of the different research tracks (Two from my track and one from each of the other two tracks) for an oral exam concerning the paper and more importantly my ability to &amp;ldquo;think on my feet.&amp;rdquo; If all goes well, then I&amp;rsquo;ll be continuing on my way towards getting a PhD in biomedical engineering.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Keeping Your Desktops in Sync with Dropbox</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/keeping-your-desktop-in-sync-with-dropbox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2012 21:04:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/keeping-your-desktop-in-sync-with-dropbox/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ever since I got my desktop and relegated my laptop to predominately being my work office computer, I have become heavily reliant upon the incredible &lt;a href="http://db.tt/1M1kZsG" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dropbox&lt;/a> for keeping my files synchronized across the two computers.

After an excruciating two-day wait, the part finally came in and I began the installation process of this gargantuan new cooling unit that just barely fit into my case. The new heatsink offered easily 10x more surface area for heat dissipation, which drastically increased the cooling efficiency of the running CPU. With the stock cooler, I saw the CPU idling around 45-50C. In stark contrast, the overclocked system now idles around 35C.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>eSports at SXSW 2012</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/esports-at-sxsw-2012/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Mar 2012 16:12:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/esports-at-sxsw-2012/</guid><description>&lt;p>I went to my first SXSW event this past Saturday (despite the absolute deluge of rain) at the Palmer Event Center for the &lt;a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/screenburn" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Screenburn Arcade&lt;/a> where the IGN Pro League was putting on a StarCraft 2 showmatch between two community-voted players. Interestingly enough, the players Millenium.Stephano and TteSports.WhiteRa ended up being the winners of the IPL StarLeagues 2 and 3, respectively, which made the match feel even more epic. The Frenchman, Ilyes &amp;ldquo;Stephano&amp;rdquo; Satouri, is arguably the best foreigner (non-Korean) player in the world and definitely one of the best Zerg players globally. Aleksey &amp;ldquo;White-Ra&amp;rdquo; Krupnyk, hails from the Ukraine, and has been a long-time community favorite for his Protoss &amp;ldquo;special tactics&amp;rdquo; and broken English phrases that are frequently absorbed into the StarCraft eSports lexicon.

After a quick backup and swap to the recommended radio, I flashed the new ICS-based ROM and was quite pleasantly surprised by the improvements in the latest iteration of the Android operating system (4.0.3 in this case). Aside from feeling considerably more responsive, this ICS build really seems to fix a lot of issues that afflicted the older Gingerbread ROMs I&amp;rsquo;ve used in the past.
