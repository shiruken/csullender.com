By late afternoon on February 15th, the Austin Fire Department&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.austintexas.gov/fact/default.cfm>Active Fire Incidents</a> page was filled with dozens of &ldquo;BWP - Broken Water Pipe&rdquo; incident reports.</p><p>Since this page only displays &ldquo;active&rdquo; incidents, I started tracking all unique reports in order to monitor the unfolding water pipe disaster. I also used a Twitter account that shares these reports (<a href=https://twitter.com/afdincidents>@afdincidents</a>) to backfill data prior to the start of my own tracking.</p><h3 id=incidents-over-time>Incidents over Time
<a class=heading-link href=#incidents-over-time><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>Between February 14 and 22, over 2,100 broken water pipe incidents were reported with the <a href=https://twitter.com/AustinFireInfo/status/1361828649507332098>AFD only able to respond to a fraction of these calls</a>. The majority of incidents were reported on February 15th and 16th as temperatures plummeted into the single digits (in Fahrenheit) overnight with a peak of almost <strong>90 reports in a single hour</strong>. As temperatures warmed to near freezing on February 17th, the report rate declined substantially despite power <a href=https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2021/02/21/austin-energy-power-back-100-percent-customers-after-ercot-shutdown/4536979001/>not being fully restored until several days later on February 21st</a>.</p><p><img src=hourly.png alt="Chart of hourly broken water pipe incident reports"></p><h3 id=localizing-incidents>Localizing Incidents
<a class=heading-link href=#localizing-incidents><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>Since the AFD incidents included exact addresses, I was able to localize the reports across the Austin area using the <a href=https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/>Folium</a> Python module to generate heatmaps. In order to protect anonymity, I&rsquo;m only sharing zoomed out screenshots rather than the full interactive map that contains specific addresses.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s an overview of the entire Austin area:</p><p><img src=heatmap_overview.png alt="Heatmap of broken water pipe incident reports across Austin"></p><p>Zoomed in on Central Austin, where you&rsquo;ll notice the University of Texas escaped largely unscathed while the surrounding neighborhoods experienced some of most broken water pipe incidents:</p><p><img src=heatmap_central.png alt="Heatmap of broken water pipe incident reports in Central Austin"></p><p>Zoomed in on North Austin:</p><p><img src=heatmap_north.png alt="Heatmap of broken water pipe incident reports in North Austin"></p><p>Zoomed in on South Austin:</p><p><img src=heatmap_south.png alt="Heatmap of broken water pipe incident reports in South Austin"></p><p>Finally, I aggregated the incident reports by ZIP code to create this interactive choropleth map:</p><iframe src=map.html width=100% height=600 frameborder=0></iframe><p>The ZIP code with the most incidents was 78759 located along US 183 and west of Mopac in northwest Austin. It&rsquo;s difficult to say why exactly this region was hit so hard, but it could be a combination of a lack of critical infrastructure that resulted in longer blackouts and newer home/apartment construction of potentially questionable quality.</p></div><footer><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//csullender.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
