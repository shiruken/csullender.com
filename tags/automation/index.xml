Using the super-app &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tasker&lt;/a> and a 3rd-party plugin called &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intangibleobject.securesettings.plugin" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secure Settings&lt;/a> I was able to swap the Location Mode of my Nexus 5 between the two modes. However, this was a poor solution since closing an app would result in disabling GPS access, which was undesirable if navigation was currently active. Furthermore, closing an app and returning to it would result in deactivation regardless of the timing. Despite numerous suggestions in the comments, none of them provided a viable answer. Since then, I purchased a &lt;a href="http://amzn.com/B005NLQAHS" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bluetooth OBD&lt;/a> (On-Board Diagnostic) tool to use with the very cool app &lt;a href="https://dash.by/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dash&lt;/a>. This device remains on at all times and the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dashlabs.dash.android&amp;amp;hl=en" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dash app&lt;/a> is set to automatically connect whenever in range. This automatic connection via Bluetooth is what makes the following modifications to my automatic Location Mode toggling task possible. In practice, any automatically-connecting Bluetooth device in your car (or part of your car) could allow you to use this technique. &lt;strong>As before, you will need root access for Secure Settings to properly function.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automatically Toggle 'High Accuracy' Location Mode on Android</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/automatic-high-accuracy-android-location/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2014 22:53:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/automatic-high-accuracy-android-location/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://csullender.com/posts/automatic-android-location-mode-toggling/" title="Automatic Android Location Mode Toggling 2.0" >&lt;strong>Check out this blog post for an updated Android Location Mode toggling task&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of Android&amp;rsquo;s most innovative features is &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/landing/now/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Now&lt;/a>, a service that attempts to provide relevant information to the user based on location and time. Unfortunately, in order to utilize the location-based service, your smartphone must provide location information to Google at expense of battery life. When Android 4.4 &amp;ldquo;Kitkat&amp;rdquo; was released in late October, the location settings were updated to include three different modes: High accuracy, battery saving, and device only. The &amp;lsquo;high accuracy&amp;rsquo; mode utilizes GPS, Wi-Fi, and mobile networks to determine location, &amp;lsquo;battery saving&amp;rsquo; only uses Wi-Fi and mobile networks, and &amp;lsquo;device only&amp;rsquo; relies exclusively on GPS.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Get the Price of Bitcoin with Google Now</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/google-now-bitcoin-price/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2014 00:31:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/google-now-bitcoin-price/</guid><description>&lt;p>The digital currency &lt;a href="http://bitcoin.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin&lt;/a> has &lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/charts/market-cap" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grown increasingly popular&lt;/a> in &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=bitcoin&amp;amp;date=1%2F2012%2025m&amp;amp;cmpt=q" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent months&lt;/a> as &lt;a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more and more businesses have begun accepting&lt;/a> the peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. Keeping up with the highly volatile price of Bitcion (BTC) is a must for traders, who use exchanges such as &lt;a href="https://www.mtgox.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mt.Gox&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://btc-e.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC-E&lt;/a> to turn a profit. Even the casual holder through services such as &lt;a href="https://coinbase.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase&lt;/a> need to see how much their BTC are worth. While there are &lt;a href="http://bitcoinwisdom.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many websites&lt;/a> that track the price of BTC across exchanges, there is no official integration into Google&amp;rsquo;s search engine. For Android users, Google Now/Search is at the heart of their device&amp;rsquo;s functionality. &lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=48109086#post48109086" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MohammadAG recently released an XPOSED module&lt;/a> that adds an API to the Google Search app. This guide will help you install the necessary applications and modifications to use the &amp;ldquo;Okay Google&amp;rdquo; voice command to get the current price of Bitcoin on Mt.Gox from &lt;a href="http://bitcoinwisdom.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BitcoinWisdom&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
