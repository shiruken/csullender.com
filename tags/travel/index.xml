Here are a select few with &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shiruken/sets/72157631087676880/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many more available&lt;/a> on my Flickr account. Sadly there was almost no snow in the park, which is apparently very unusual (thanks a lot global warming). Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to visit again around Christmas so there should be plenty of that annoying white precipitation on the ground.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
