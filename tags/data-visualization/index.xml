As Austin Energy struggled to implement rolling blackouts to reduce energy demand, many neighborhoods in the city went multiple days without electricity during record-breaking cold weather. With residents suddenly unable to heat their homes, Austin and Travis County emergency services were flooded with calls about broken water pipes.</description></item><item><title>Three Years of 'Science GIFs' on Google+</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/three-years-of-science-gifs-on-google/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 May 2018 03:13:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/three-years-of-science-gifs-on-google/</guid><description>Three years ago, Google announced the Collections feature on the Google+ social network. It offered a way to group posts by topic so that others could follow their specific interests rather than your entire profile. I created two collections, Data is Beautiful and Science GIFs, the latter of which I&amp;rsquo;ve maintained for almost three years now. Every week I post a science-related GIF and an accompanying explanation of the finding, physical phenomenon, or chemical reaction.</description></item><item><title>Reddit and the Death of Stephen Hawking</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/reddit-and-the-death-of-stephen-hawking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Apr 2018 04:46:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/reddit-and-the-death-of-stephen-hawking/</guid><description>As the news of Stephen Hawking&amp;rsquo;s death reverberated across the internet, the r/science community on Reddit made an unusual post: An opportunity to discuss the life of one of humanity&amp;rsquo;s greatest minds. It was the first post of its kind in a subreddit normally dedicated to talking about science papers. However, the moderator team decided his passing warranted acknowledgement given his contributions to physics and his role as the most widely recognized science communicator on the planet.</description></item><item><title>SXSW 2015</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/sxsw-2015/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2015 02:26:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/sxsw-2015/</guid><description>Another year, another South By, another week of extensive walking and partaking in free parties and concerts. SXSW 2015 has truly turned Austin into a spring break for mid 20-year-olds. As usual, I always go in with zero expectations and just tried to have a good time.
The first big event was on Saturday at Amy Poehler&amp;rsquo;s Smart Girls Party at Banger&amp;rsquo;s Sausage House and Beer Garden which was also where Geek &amp;amp; Sundry and Tabletop had all-day events.</description></item><item><title>Hackintosh 2.0 Benchmark</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/hackintosh-2.0-benchmark/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Mar 2015 21:37:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/hackintosh-2.0-benchmark/</guid><description>Since I am obsessed with quantifying things, I absolutely had to benchmark my new Hackintosh rig to see what my new purchases had afforded cost me. I ran a handful of different benchmarks under both OS X and Windows boots to see what the Intel Core i5-4690K, EVGA GeForce GTX 970 SC, and Samsung 850 Pro could do. So without further ado, here are the results of my benchmarks!
Geekbench Tested processor performance across Hackintosh v1.</description></item><item><title>Google Scholar Visualization</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/google-scholar-visualization/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2015 16:59:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/google-scholar-visualization/</guid><description>One of the most common images I see during science presentations is the frequency of publications within a particular field over time. It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to show the growth of the field while attempting to validate the worthiness of the research that follows. As far as I can tell, most people manually assemble this data with sequential searches on Google Scholar or Web of Science. This seemed like a straightforward opportunity for automation, so I made a little website (Deprecated July 2022) that does just that.</description></item><item><title>Half a Year with Dash</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/half-a-year-with-dash/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2014 20:48:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/half-a-year-with-dash/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Dash in my car for almost six months now to track my driving habits and monitor my car&amp;rsquo;s status. The app interfaces over Bluetooth with an OBD device to read engine codes and access metrics such as speed, fuel efficiency, and engine status. The app tracks every trip and assigns a &amp;ldquo;Driving Score&amp;rdquo; based on driving behavior to encourage &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; driving habits. Currently the only way to access the data is via an IFTTT channel that logs each trip to a line of a Google Spreadsheet.</description></item><item><title>SXSW 2014</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/sxsw-2014/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2014 00:43:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/sxsw-2014/</guid><description>Another crazy SXSW has come and gone in Austin, TX, and I&amp;rsquo;m completely exhausted. Unlike the past two years where most of my participation was during the Music portion of the festival, I explored extensively during Interactive (i.e. earlier). The biggest events I attended were the Dropbox party and the multi-day Rachael Ray Feedback House Party. The first was at a brand new bar on Rainey Street called Container Bar and featured live music from Wild Cub (they&amp;rsquo;re gonna blow up).</description></item><item><title>200k LastFM Scrobbles</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/200k-lastfm-scrobbles/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 May 2013 20:25:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/200k-lastfm-scrobbles/</guid><description>I recently surpassed the 200,000 song scrobble mark on LastFM since joining way back in March 2005. I threw together a little infographic summarizing my overall top artists, albums, and songs over the past 8+ years. I&amp;rsquo;m going to make a yearly summary so that all my charts aren&amp;rsquo;t overwhelmed by the stuff I listened to back in high school. Click on the image for the full-sized infographic. Everything was created in Adobe Illustrator using information and images from the LastFM website.</description></item><item><title>3 Months of Fitbit</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/3-months-of-fitbit/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2013 23:31:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/3-months-of-fitbit/</guid><description>I bought myself a Fitbit One right before the New Year in hopes of motivating more physical activity to offset my stationary lab lifestyle. It&amp;rsquo;s been just over three months since I started tracking my daily steps and most of my sleep. While I haven&amp;rsquo;t started running yet (I promise I&amp;rsquo;ll start eventually), it&amp;rsquo;s been fascinating to see my walking activity tracked throughout the day. One of my biggest complaints about Fitbit&amp;rsquo;s services is that they make you pay to access in-depth information about your activity.</description></item><item><title>Upgrades and Overclocks</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/upgrades-and-overclocks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2012 22:06:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/upgrades-and-overclocks/</guid><description>After about two months of using my new Hackintosh without any custom modifications, I decided I wanted to overclock my 3.3GHz Intel Core i5-2500K processor a little bit to see if I would notice a performance increase. However, in order to do this, the horribly inadequate stock Intel CPU cooler needed to be replaced. After a brief search online, I settled on the Cooler Master Hyper 212+ as a suitable replacement for my CPU cooling needs.</description></item></channel></rss>
