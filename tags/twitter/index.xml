It was originally powered by some datasets pulled from &lt;a href="http://www.tweetstats.com/" title="Visit Tweetstats" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TweetStats&lt;/a> but I eventually upgraded it to run entirely from my own server. It was extremely barebones and grabbed my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shiruken" title="View My Twitter" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter&lt;/a> feed every hour and downloaded all the tweets that had been added since the previous update. Unfortunately, because Twitter does not offer the entire tweeting history via the website or this XML feed, I was missing well over a year of data. Combined with problems accessing this feed, I would regularly lose my entire (local) cache of my Twitter feed and have to spend a lot of time fixing everything. I eventually just decided to kill off the page since I was losing more and more of the older tweets every time I had to fix the cache and Twitter was changing the way the feed was presented.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
