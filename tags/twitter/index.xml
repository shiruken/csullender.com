It was originally powered by some datasets pulled from TweetStats but I eventually upgraded it to run entirely from my own server. It was extremely barebones and grabbed my Twitter feed every hour and downloaded all the tweets that had been added since the previous update. Unfortunately, because Twitter does not offer the entire tweeting history via the website or this XML feed, I was missing well over a year of data.</description></item></channel></rss>
