I rarely post blog entries anymore, so the convenience of the WordPress text editor and dynamic content has lost its appeal, especially since this website now primarily serves as a digital portfolio.

I needed an easy way to automatically transfer data from my collection computer to the lab server for storage and to my office computer for post-processing. While I have much more free storage than your average non-paying Dropbox user, I needed to regularly transfer tens of gigabytes of files without any need of uploading to the Internet/cloud. BitTorrent Sync seemed to fulfill that need almost perfectly and was vastly easier than constantly running rsync commands.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hackintosh 2.0</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/hackintosh-2.0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2015 04:58:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/hackintosh-2.0/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been roughly two years since I built my &lt;a href="https://csullender.com/posts/the-hackintosh/" title="The Hackintosh" >original Hackintosh&lt;/a> desktop computer and I decided earlier this year that the time was ripe for an upgrade. After considerable waffling on the exact components to get, I finally settled on an relatively high-end build largely based on the &lt;a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/building-customac-buyers-guide-december-2014.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December CustoMac Buyer&amp;rsquo;s Guide&lt;/a> that reused a few components from my original Hackintosh (&lt;a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811139008" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817371031" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">power supply&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231429" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memory&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The most difficult decision by far concerned the graphics card since the current generation &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/specs/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mac Pro&lt;/a> uses a custom AMD GPU whereas most Hackintosh guides recommend NVIDIA cards. Since there are currently no Macs with any of these NVIDIA cards, there is no native support for them in OS X. This obviously makes using them a little more difficult compared to my first build which basically worked out-of-box. After &lt;a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/graphics/143435-nvidia-releases-alternate-graphics-drivers-10-10-0-343-01-01-maxwell-geforce-gtx-970-980-support.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extensive research&lt;/a>, I decided on the &lt;a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814487076" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce GTX 970&lt;/a> since recently released &lt;a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/graphics/155506-nvidia-releases-alternate-graphics-drivers-10-10-2-343-02-02-a.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alternate drivers from NVIDIA&lt;/a> made the card viable on OS X 10.10 Yosemite without too much trouble.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Full Page Background Image with CSS3</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/full-page-background-image/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2015 06:08:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/full-page-background-image/</guid><description>&lt;p>Several of the websites I&amp;rsquo;ve created use a background image as part of the design.

Using the super-app &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tasker&lt;/a> and a 3rd-party plugin called &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intangibleobject.securesettings.plugin" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secure Settings&lt;/a> I was able to swap the Location Mode of my Nexus 5 between the two modes. However, this was a poor solution since closing an app would result in disabling GPS access, which was undesirable if navigation was currently active. Furthermore, closing an app and returning to it would result in deactivation regardless of the timing. Despite numerous suggestions in the comments, none of them provided a viable answer. Since then, I purchased a &lt;a href="http://amzn.com/B005NLQAHS" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bluetooth OBD&lt;/a> (On-Board Diagnostic) tool to use with the very cool app &lt;a href="https://dash.by/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dash&lt;/a>.

This automatic connection via Bluetooth is what makes the following modifications to my automatic Location Mode toggling task possible. In practice, any automatically-connecting Bluetooth device in your car (or part of your car) could allow you to use this technique. &lt;strong>As before, you will need root access for Secure Settings to properly function.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automatically Toggle 'High Accuracy' Location Mode on Android</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/automatic-high-accuracy-android-location/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2014 22:53:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/automatic-high-accuracy-android-location/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://csullender.com/posts/automatic-android-location-mode-toggling/" title="Automatic Android Location Mode Toggling 2.0" >&lt;strong>Check out this blog post for an updated Android Location Mode toggling task&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of Android&amp;rsquo;s most innovative features is &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/landing/now/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Now&lt;/a>, a service that attempts to provide relevant information to the user based on location and time. Unfortunately, in order to utilize the location-based service, your smartphone must provide location information to Google at expense of battery life. When Android 4.4 &amp;ldquo;Kitkat&amp;rdquo; was released in late October, the location settings were updated to include three different modes: High accuracy, battery saving, and device only. The &amp;lsquo;high accuracy&amp;rsquo; mode utilizes GPS, Wi-Fi, and mobile networks to determine location, &amp;lsquo;battery saving&amp;rsquo; only uses Wi-Fi and mobile networks, and &amp;lsquo;device only&amp;rsquo; relies exclusively on GPS.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quickstart Dogecoin blockchain sync with bootstrap.dat</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/quickstart-dogecoin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2014 01:00:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/quickstart-dogecoin/</guid><description>&lt;p>While &lt;a href="http://bitcoin.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin&lt;/a> is the undisputed leader of the cryptocurrency world, a meme-based alternative called &lt;a href="http://dogecoin.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dogecoin&lt;/a> has gained steam over the past month. Sporting the comical Shiba Inu dog character from the &amp;ldquo;doge&amp;rdquo; meme, this altcoin gained significant media coverage recently after &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/20/jamaican-bobsled-team-raises-dogecoin-winter-olympics" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helping raise $30,000 for the Jamaican bobsled team&lt;/a> for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Promoters of this cryptocurrency have been extremely vocal about the carefree attitude surrounding Dogecoin and actively encourage giving freely to others (tipping) in order to raise awareness. The userbase has exploded since its December 6, 2013, introduction with over 33 billion Dogecoin mined to date. The growing online presence and transaction volume have caused the Dogecoin &lt;a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain&lt;/a> to swell to over 2GB in size. The &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1upa5y/bounty_15_million_doge_for_the_first_person_to/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lack of a thin client&lt;/a> means that new users must download and verify the entire blockchain before they can participate. While online wallets do exist, many users are wary following a &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/26/5244604/millions-of-dogecoin-stolen-in-christmas-hack" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christmas Day hack&lt;/a> that resulted in the loss of millions of Dogecoin. The desktop wallet software offers client-side encryption and eliminates the need to trust a third party to secure your assets. The downsides of the desktop client are the extremely slow initial sync and need to constantly resync with the blockchain network. Fortunately there&amp;rsquo;s a trick that can help speed up the initial blockchain download by loading the blockchain from a local file rather than the network.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Get the Price of Bitcoin with Google Now</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/google-now-bitcoin-price/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2014 00:31:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/google-now-bitcoin-price/</guid><description>&lt;p>The digital currency &lt;a href="http://bitcoin.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin&lt;/a> has &lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/charts/market-cap" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grown increasingly popular&lt;/a> in &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=bitcoin&amp;amp;date=1%2F2012%2025m&amp;amp;cmpt=q" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent months&lt;/a> as &lt;a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more and more businesses have begun accepting&lt;/a> the peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. Keeping up with the highly volatile price of Bitcion (BTC) is a must for traders, who use exchanges such as &lt;a href="https://www.mtgox.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mt.Gox&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://btc-e.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC-E&lt;/a> to turn a profit. Even the casual holder through services such as &lt;a href="https://coinbase.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase&lt;/a> need to see how much their BTC are worth. While there are &lt;a href="http://bitcoinwisdom.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many websites&lt;/a> that track the price of BTC across exchanges, there is no official integration into Google&amp;rsquo;s search engine. For Android users, Google Now/Search is at the heart of their device&amp;rsquo;s functionality. &lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=48109086#post48109086" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MohammadAG recently released an XPOSED module&lt;/a> that adds an API to the Google Search app. This guide will help you install the necessary applications and modifications to use the &amp;ldquo;Okay Google&amp;rdquo; voice command to get the current price of Bitcoin on Mt.Gox from &lt;a href="http://bitcoinwisdom.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BitcoinWisdom&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fixing a Broken Google Wallet</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/fixing-a-broken-google-wallet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jan 2013 03:06:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/fixing-a-broken-google-wallet/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently upgraded to a Google Nexus 4 phone from my old HTC Inspire HD. Unfortunately, the original device that I received had some problems with the ear-piece, resulting in a very noticeable static hissing noise during calls and even when the phone wasn&amp;rsquo;t in use. I decided to RMA the defective device to Google in exchange for a replacement. After several weeks of waiting, I finally got my hands on my Rev. 11 Google Nexus 4 (original was Rev. 10) and prepared to transfer over to the new phone. I opted to use a standard &lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/wiki/NANDroid" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nandroid backup&lt;/a> of the original device&amp;rsquo;s content in order to transfer everything to the new device (essentially duplicating the content). Unfortunately, I did not pay attention to the &lt;a href="http://support.google.com/wallet/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=2478688" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommended process of transferring Google Wallet&lt;/a> to this new device, which suggests reseting the original device&amp;rsquo;s Wallet application prior to the transition. This is necessary so that the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/wallet/faq.html#security-and-privacy-in-store" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secure Element&lt;/a> created on the device by Google Wallet isn&amp;rsquo;t accidentally transferred to the new device. This secure element can only be accessed by a SINGLE instance of Google Wallet, so if it is transferred to a new phone or even restored to a new ROM on the same device, it can result in Wallet completely losing functionality. Because I failed to reset the Google Wallet app, which removes the secure element, prior to performing the nandroid backup, I inadvertently transferred the secure element and the linked Google Wallet app to the new phone. Unfortunately, this resulted in the breaking of Google Wallet on my RMA Nexus 4 device.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Keeping your Papers Library Synced</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/papers-sync/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2012 00:32:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/papers-sync/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a graduate student, one of the most important tools I use practically every single day is a citation and bibliography reference manager.

I rarely needed access to the contents of my Bootcamp installation so I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be nice to prevent the partition from mounting at all on the Mac side of things. There&amp;rsquo;s a relatively easy way to achieve this using just a little bit of command line fiddling. The only thing you need is administrative rights on the computer. The first thing we need to know is the Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) of the Bootcamp partition that you want to prevent from automatically mounting. Open up the &lt;strong>Disk Utility&lt;/strong> application located in the Utilities folder of your Application folder. Locate the desired partition in the list on the left as shown below.

While developers will scramble to get their apps ready for the sweeping changes oft accompanied by an upgrade to an operating system, it is inevitable that bugs/quirks/errors will surface. As an engineering graduate student, one of the programs I use quite frequently is &lt;a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MATLAB&lt;/a>, which is built upon the X11 window system for the Apple OS environment. In the latest update to OS X, &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5293" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple decided to remove X11&lt;/a> in favor of an open-source development called XQuartz. What this means is that if you upgrade to Mountain Lion, MATLAB cannot run because X11 is no longer included in the operating system. While I&amp;rsquo;m sure many will complain about Apple&amp;rsquo;s apparent lack of support for one of the most commonly used technical programs, they did not truly abandon X11. Rather, they have provided development support to the &lt;a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XQuartz project&lt;/a> which is effectively an updated version of X11 which was first included in Mac OS X 10.5.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Upgrading to Mountain Lion</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/upgrading-to-mountain-lion/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jul 2012 19:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/upgrading-to-mountain-lion/</guid><description>&lt;p>The release of the latest Apple computer operating system &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OS X 10.8 &amp;lsquo;Mountain Lion&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a> has been a &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/30/apple-reports-three-million-mountain-lion-downloads-in-four-days/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resounding success&lt;/a> with over 3 million copies sold in less than four days.

After installing the $20 update onto my laptop, I finally decided to give it a whirl on &lt;a href="http://www.csullender.com/blog/2012/02/12/the-hackintosh/" title="The Hackintosh" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my Hackintosh.&lt;/a> I used the &lt;a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/61-unibeast-1-5-install-os-x-mountain-lion-any-supported-intel-based-pc.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unibeast&lt;/a> tool from the aforementioned &lt;a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/home.php" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TonyMacx86&lt;/a> community to create a bootable flash drive with the Mountain Lion installer. A typical installation would then simply require booting off the flash drive, selecting the installation drive, and then enjoying the new OS. Unfortunately, my graphics card (ATI Radeon HD 6870) has had issues with the installation process and requires a few extra steps to get everything working. Without these additional modifications, the installer hangs at the launch screen indefinitely. This fix should work for any ATI Radeon 6XXX card but I have only tried it on the 6870.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Keeping Your Desktops in Sync with Dropbox</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/keeping-your-desktop-in-sync-with-dropbox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2012 21:04:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/keeping-your-desktop-in-sync-with-dropbox/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ever since I got my desktop and relegated my laptop to predominately being my work office computer, I have become heavily reliant upon the incredible &lt;a href="http://db.tt/1M1kZsG" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dropbox&lt;/a> for keeping my files synchronized across the two computers.
