I ran a handful of different benchmarks under both OS X and Windows boots to see what the Intel Core i5-4690K, EVGA GeForce GTX 970 SC, and Samsung 850 Pro could do. So without further ado, here are the results of my benchmarks!

After considerable waffling on the exact components to get, I finally settled on an relatively high-end build largely based on the December CustoMac Buyer&amp;rsquo;s Guide that reused a few components from my original Hackintosh (case, power supply, and memory).

As with any system update, the Hackintosh community anxiously starts refreshing their favorite websites (TonyMacx86) in hopes of reading tales of successful installations before attempting it themselves. After installing the $20 update onto my laptop, I finally decided to give it a whirl on my Hackintosh.</description></item><item><title>Upgrades and Overclocks</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/upgrades-and-overclocks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2012 22:06:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/upgrades-and-overclocks/</guid><description>After about two months of using my new Hackintosh without any custom modifications, I decided I wanted to overclock my 3.3GHz Intel Core i5-2500K processor a little bit to see if I would notice a performance increase. However, in order to do this, the horribly inadequate stock Intel CPU cooler needed to be replaced. After a brief search online, I settled on the Cooler Master Hyper 212+ as a suitable replacement for my CPU cooling needs.</description></item><item><title>The Hackintosh</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/the-hackintosh/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Feb 2012 22:09:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/the-hackintosh/</guid><description>In the weeks leading up to my winter break from classes, I decided I was going to build a gaming computer since I was tired of playing on my laptop. While I was originally planning on just building a beastly Windows machine, I realized it was now ridiculously easy to throw together parts to make a &amp;ldquo;Hackintosh,&amp;rdquo; or a computer running Mac OS X minus the Apple hardware and price. I spent several weeks researching the viability of the Hackintosh build, predominately on TonyMacX86, and selecting the components for my system.</description></item></channel></rss>
