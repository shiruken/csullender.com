It was the first post of its kind in a subreddit normally dedicated to talking about science papers. However, the moderator team decided his passing warranted acknowledgement given his contributions to physics and his role as the most widely recognized science communicator on the planet. He had also previously participated in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3nyn5i/science_ama_series_stephen_hawking_ama_answers/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Ask Me Anything&lt;/a> in our subreddit.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
