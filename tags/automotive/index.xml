The app interfaces over Bluetooth with an OBD device to read engine codes and access metrics such as speed, fuel efficiency, and engine status. The app tracks every trip and assigns a &amp;ldquo;Driving Score&amp;rdquo; based on driving behavior to encourage &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; driving habits. Currently the only way to access the data is &lt;a href="https://ifttt.com/dash" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via an IFTTT channel&lt;/a> that logs each trip to a line of a Google Spreadsheet. The developer is working on an &lt;a href="https://dash.by/developers" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">API (aptly named Chassis)&lt;/a> that will hopefully make access to the data even easier in the coming future. In the meantime, I just used the IFTTT spreadsheet output to assemble some stats and charts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MotoGP ATX 2014</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/motogp-atx-2014/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2014 01:28:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/motogp-atx-2014/</guid><description>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://www.motogp.com/en/events/Americas/2014" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Bull Grand Prix of the Americas&lt;/a> was this past weekend at the &lt;a href="http://circuitoftheamericas.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Circuit of the Americas&lt;/a> in Austin, TX. The event spans three days with practice and qualifiers occurring on Saturday and the races for the three classes (MotoGP, Moto2, and Moto3) occurring on Sunday. I attended both days of weekend events and had a great time watching beastly motorcycles roar past &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@30.1300364,-97.6369164,252m/data=!3m1!1e3" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turn 1&lt;/a>.
