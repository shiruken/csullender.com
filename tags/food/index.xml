The eighth installment of Peter Voyvodic&amp;rsquo;s celebration of the nominees for Academy Award for Best Picture was just as crazy and just as much fun as ever. There&amp;rsquo;s something exhilarating about cramming 50+ people into a tiny studio apartment and preparing an 8-dish offering. The menu and dishes are pictured below.

I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to attend the past two years (since I&amp;rsquo;ve been in Austin) and it has always been a blast. Last year I had a ton of fun assisting with the Sunday food preparation so I was anxious to help again this year.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
