The app interfaces over Bluetooth with an OBD device to read engine codes and access metrics such as speed, fuel efficiency, and engine status. The app tracks every trip and assigns a &amp;ldquo;Driving Score&amp;rdquo; based on driving behavior to encourage &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; driving habits. Currently the only way to access the data is via an IFTTT channel that logs each trip to a line of a Google Spreadsheet.</description></item><item><title>Foursquare Heatmap</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/foursquare-heatmap/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2013 23:06:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/foursquare-heatmap/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m a regular user of the location-based social network Foursquare mainly as a source of recommendations for new places to try. I typically check in everywhere I go with the exception of private residences (can&amp;rsquo;t let people stalk me that easily), so I have a pretty extensive log covering my location history. While it&amp;rsquo;s not quite as extensive as the Google Maps Location History, it does a good job representing the places I visit.</description></item><item><title>200k LastFM Scrobbles</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/200k-lastfm-scrobbles/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 May 2013 20:25:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/200k-lastfm-scrobbles/</guid><description>I recently surpassed the 200,000 song scrobble mark on LastFM since joining way back in March 2005. I threw together a little infographic summarizing my overall top artists, albums, and songs over the past 8+ years. I&amp;rsquo;m going to make a yearly summary so that all my charts aren&amp;rsquo;t overwhelmed by the stuff I listened to back in high school. Click on the image for the full-sized infographic. Everything was created in Adobe Illustrator using information and images from the LastFM website.</description></item><item><title>3 Months of Fitbit</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/3-months-of-fitbit/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2013 23:31:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/3-months-of-fitbit/</guid><description>I bought myself a Fitbit One right before the New Year in hopes of motivating more physical activity to offset my stationary lab lifestyle. It&amp;rsquo;s been just over three months since I started tracking my daily steps and most of my sleep. While I haven&amp;rsquo;t started running yet (I promise I&amp;rsquo;ll start eventually), it&amp;rsquo;s been fascinating to see my walking activity tracked throughout the day. One of my biggest complaints about Fitbit&amp;rsquo;s services is that they make you pay to access in-depth information about your activity.</description></item></channel></rss>
