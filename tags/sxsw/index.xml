SXSW 2015 has truly turned Austin into a spring break for mid 20-year-olds. As usual, I always go in with zero expectations and just tried to have a good time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first big event was on Saturday at &lt;a href="http://family.do512.com/smartgirlsparty" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Poehler&amp;rsquo;s Smart Girls Party&lt;/a> at Banger&amp;rsquo;s Sausage House and Beer Garden which was also where &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/geekandsundry" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geek &amp;amp; Sundry&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7atuZxmT956cWFGxqSyRdn6GWhBxiAwE" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tabletop&lt;/a> had all-day events.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SXSW 2014</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/sxsw-2014/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2014 00:43:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/sxsw-2014/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another crazy &lt;a href="http://sxsw.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SXSW&lt;/a> has come and gone in Austin, TX, and I&amp;rsquo;m completely exhausted. Unlike the past two years where most of my participation was during the Music portion of the festival, I explored extensively during Interactive (i.e. earlier). The biggest events I attended were the Dropbox party and the multi-day Rachael Ray Feedback House Party. The first was at a brand new bar on Rainey Street called &lt;a href="http://austincontainerbar.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Container Bar&lt;/a> and featured live music from Wild Cub (they&amp;rsquo;re gonna blow up). The second was at an event space on East Cesar Chavez called &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Chick-Ranch-Austin/697801683571177" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chick Ranch&lt;/a> and featured tons of live bands and BBQ from a Chicago restaurant called &lt;a href="http://www.lilliesq.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lillies&lt;/a>. I managed to snag invites to both events for myself and a ton of my friends through some Twitter magic. Besides those, I walked around to a ton of the open venues all across downtown Austin to catch music and eat/drink free stuff.

Interestingly enough, the players Millenium.Stephano and TteSports.WhiteRa ended up being the winners of the IPL StarLeagues 2 and 3, respectively, which made the match feel even more epic. The Frenchman, Ilyes &amp;ldquo;Stephano&amp;rdquo; Satouri, is arguably the best foreigner (non-Korean) player in the world and definitely one of the best Zerg players globally. Aleksey &amp;ldquo;White-Ra&amp;rdquo; Krupnyk, hails from the Ukraine, and has been a long-time community favorite for his Protoss &amp;ldquo;special tactics&amp;rdquo; and broken English phrases that are frequently absorbed into the StarCraft eSports lexicon. It was awesome seeing these people play in person after being limited to &lt;a href="http://twitch.tv" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TwitchTV&lt;/a> streams and &lt;a href="http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Major League Gaming&lt;/a> events in the past. Nothing beats a live crowd, especially when an &lt;a href="http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Archon_toilet" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Archon Toilet&lt;/a> results in the nearly instantaneous death of 10+ Brood Lords and a complete change in momentum.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
