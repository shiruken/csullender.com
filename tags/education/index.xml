We&amp;rsquo;ve recently had some changes in the leadership and I&amp;rsquo;m now the Treasurer for the group. One of the tasks I decided to undertake was an updated website that keeps better track of our upcoming events as well as helping members announce their publications and achievements. Unfortunately the webspace we&amp;rsquo;re provided by UT is very limited and pretty much can only allow for static webpages (sadly cannot use Wordpress).</description></item><item><title>The Qualifying Exam: Part II</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/the-qualifying-exam-part-ii/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jun 2012 15:45:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/the-qualifying-exam-part-ii/</guid><description>As of yesterday afternoon I have completed and passed my qualifying exam for the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Texas. As I mentioned in an earlier blog post, the qualifying exam consists of two parts: a written response and an oral exam with a faculty committee. The written part was extremely straightforward and really just required the reading of background papers to adequately answer the questions. More than anything it just served as a starting point for preparing for the oral examination, which is much more open-ended and difficult to predict.</description></item><item><title>The Qualifying Exam: Part I</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/the-qualifying-exam-part-i/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 May 2012 15:25:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/the-qualifying-exam-part-i/</guid><description>Today marks the beginning of my qualifying exam for becoming a PhD student in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. The exam is taken at the end of the first year of graduate school and basically is a check to make sure that you have the basic research knowledge and critical thinking skills necessary to continue onwards as a doctoral student. The exam is broken into two separate parts: a written exam and an oral exam.</description></item><item><title>Fun with Optics</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/fun-with-optics/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Mar 2012 23:34:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/fun-with-optics/</guid><description>I spent my entire Saturday helping out at Explore UT as part of a Biomedical Optics Graduate Organization (BOGO) outreach event. We held three forty-minute-long sessions with about thirty kids (8-11 years old) and taught them about optics and the properties of light. Thanks to some incredible funding from our backing organizations (OSA and SPIE), we were able to provide the kids with numerous hands-on, take-home demos including polarizers, diffraction gratings, UV color-changing beads, and a telescope.</description></item></channel></rss>
