SXSW 2015 has truly turned Austin into a spring break for mid 20-year-olds. As usual, I always go in with zero expectations and just tried to have a good time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first big event was on Saturday at &lt;a href="http://family.do512.com/smartgirlsparty" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Poehler&amp;rsquo;s Smart Girls Party&lt;/a> at Banger&amp;rsquo;s Sausage House and Beer Garden which was also where &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/geekandsundry" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geek &amp;amp; Sundry&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7atuZxmT956cWFGxqSyRdn6GWhBxiAwE" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tabletop&lt;/a> had all-day events.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MotoGP ATX 2014</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/motogp-atx-2014/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2014 01:28:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/motogp-atx-2014/</guid><description>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://www.motogp.com/en/events/Americas/2014" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Bull Grand Prix of the Americas&lt;/a> was this past weekend at the &lt;a href="http://circuitoftheamericas.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Circuit of the Americas&lt;/a> in Austin, TX. The event spans three days with practice and qualifiers occurring on Saturday and the races for the three classes (MotoGP, Moto2, and Moto3) occurring on Sunday. I attended both days of weekend events and had a great time watching beastly motorcycles roar past &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@30.1300364,-97.6369164,252m/data=!3m1!1e3" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turn 1&lt;/a>.

Unlike the past two years where most of my participation was during the Music portion of the festival, I explored extensively during Interactive (i.e. earlier). The biggest events I attended were the Dropbox party and the multi-day Rachael Ray Feedback House Party. The first was at a brand new bar on Rainey Street called &lt;a href="http://austincontainerbar.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Container Bar&lt;/a> and featured live music from Wild Cub (they&amp;rsquo;re gonna blow up). The second was at an event space on East Cesar Chavez called &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Chick-Ranch-Austin/697801683571177" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chick Ranch&lt;/a> and featured tons of live bands and BBQ from a Chicago restaurant called &lt;a href="http://www.lilliesq.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lillies&lt;/a>. I managed to snag invites to both events for myself and a ton of my friends through some Twitter magic. Besides those, I walked around to a ton of the open venues all across downtown Austin to catch music and eat/drink free stuff.

I typically check in everywhere I go with the exception of private residences (can&amp;rsquo;t let people stalk me that easily), so I have a pretty extensive log covering my location history. While it&amp;rsquo;s not quite as extensive as the &lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/locationhistory/b/0" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Maps Location History&lt;/a>, it does a good job representing the places I visit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Red Bull Battlegrounds</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/red-bull-battlegrounds/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2012 20:32:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/red-bull-battlegrounds/</guid><description>&lt;p>This past weekend saw the first major competitive video-gaming event take place in Austin, TX as the &lt;a href="http://www.redbullusa.com/cs/Satellite/en_US/Red-Bull-LAN/001243017356310" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Bull Battlegrounds&lt;/a> took over the &lt;a href="http://acl-live.com/venue" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moody Theater&lt;/a> for two days of StarCraft 2 action. A 16-player invitational hosted by Day[9], DJwheat, Husky, and Rob Simpson, the event was a resounding success for a non-major-league (&lt;a href="http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MLG&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="http://www.ign.com/ipl" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPL&lt;/a>) live event. I decided to only attend the second day (Sunday) of the tournament since the first day featured a round-robin tournament in which an absolute deluge of games were played. Day 2 took the top 8 players from the previous day and seeded them into a single-elimination bracket to fight for over $40k in prize money.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>eSports at SXSW 2012</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/esports-at-sxsw-2012/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Mar 2012 16:12:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/esports-at-sxsw-2012/</guid><description>&lt;p>I went to my first SXSW event this past Saturday (despite the absolute deluge of rain) at the Palmer Event Center for the &lt;a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/screenburn" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Screenburn Arcade&lt;/a> where the IGN Pro League was putting on a StarCraft 2 showmatch between two community-voted players. Interestingly enough, the players Millenium.Stephano and TteSports.WhiteRa ended up being the winners of the IPL StarLeagues 2 and 3, respectively, which made the match feel even more epic. The Frenchman, Ilyes &amp;ldquo;Stephano&amp;rdquo; Satouri, is arguably the best foreigner (non-Korean) player in the world and definitely one of the best Zerg players globally. Aleksey &amp;ldquo;White-Ra&amp;rdquo; Krupnyk, hails from the Ukraine, and has been a long-time community favorite for his Protoss &amp;ldquo;special tactics&amp;rdquo; and broken English phrases that are frequently absorbed into the StarCraft eSports lexicon. It was awesome seeing these people play in person after being limited to &lt;a href="http://twitch.tv" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TwitchTV&lt;/a> streams and &lt;a href="http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Major League Gaming&lt;/a> events in the past. Nothing beats a live crowd, especially when an &lt;a href="http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Archon_toilet" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Archon Toilet&lt;/a> results in the nearly instantaneous death of 10+ Brood Lords and a complete change in momentum.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Winter in Austin</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/winter-in-austin/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2012 18:09:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/winter-in-austin/</guid><description>&lt;p>This past week has had some absolutely incredible weather, mostly in the upper 70&amp;rsquo;s and mid 80&amp;rsquo;s, but Thursday it decided to dip up into the 90&amp;rsquo;s. After four years of Seattle winters (aka cloudy, cold, and wet), maybe Texas winters aren&amp;rsquo;t all that bad. Sadly it has already dropped back into the mid 60&amp;rsquo;s for the weekend and we might get some thunderstorms early next week. But it&amp;rsquo;s still brilliantly sunny and hopefully indicative of the weather for the next few months. Now if only there was a way to escape the inevitable Texas summer heat.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
