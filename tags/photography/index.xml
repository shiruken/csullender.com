&lt;p>A couple weeks ago there was a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android/comments/3mjxz8/tip_if_uploading_images_to_facebook_use/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit post on /r/Android&lt;/a> recommending Facebook users upload photos via the &lt;a href="http://m.facebook.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile website&lt;/a> rather than the official Android Facebook app. The app reportedly compressed an original 8MP (4.5MB) photo to only 0.6MP (100kB) whereas the mobile website uploaded at 3MP (440kB). For a typical 4:3 ratio photograph, 0.6MP works out to neither dimension having more than 1000 pixels! Viewers on almost all current smartphones and tablets would be looking at an image smaller than their screen size. For a social network so heavily driven by photographs, you would think Facebook would do a better job maintaining some modicum of image quality. Most users probably have no idea their images are being so heavily degraded by uploading via the app. This blog examines the varying quality of Facebook image uploads in an attempt to identify the best option if you must upload to Facebook.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SXSW 2015</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/sxsw-2015/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2015 02:26:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/sxsw-2015/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another year, another South By, another week of extensive walking and partaking in free parties and concerts. SXSW 2015 has truly turned Austin into a spring break for mid 20-year-olds. As usual, I always go in with zero expectations and just tried to have a good time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first big event was on Saturday at &lt;a href="http://family.do512.com/smartgirlsparty" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Poehler&amp;rsquo;s Smart Girls Party&lt;/a> at Banger&amp;rsquo;s Sausage House and Beer Garden which was also where &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/geekandsundry" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geek &amp;amp; Sundry&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7atuZxmT956cWFGxqSyRdn6GWhBxiAwE" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tabletop&lt;/a> had all-day events.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Oscar Party 8.0</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/oscar-party-8/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Mar 2015 03:47:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/oscar-party-8/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another year, &lt;a href="https://csullender.com/posts/oscarmadness/" title="#OscarMadness" >another Oscar Party&lt;/a>. The eighth installment of Peter Voyvodic&amp;rsquo;s celebration of the nominees for Academy Award for Best Picture was just as crazy and just as much fun as ever. There&amp;rsquo;s something exhilarating about cramming 50+ people into a tiny studio apartment and preparing an 8-dish offering. The menu and dishes are pictured below.

The event spans three days with practice and qualifiers occurring on Saturday and the races for the three classes (MotoGP, Moto2, and Moto3) occurring on Sunday. I attended both days of weekend events and had a great time watching beastly motorcycles roar past &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@30.1300364,-97.6369164,252m/data=!3m1!1e3" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turn 1&lt;/a>.

Unlike the past two years where most of my participation was during the Music portion of the festival, I explored extensively during Interactive (i.e. earlier). The biggest events I attended were the Dropbox party and the multi-day Rachael Ray Feedback House Party. The first was at a brand new bar on Rainey Street called &lt;a href="http://austincontainerbar.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Container Bar&lt;/a> and featured live music from Wild Cub (they&amp;rsquo;re gonna blow up). The second was at an event space on East Cesar Chavez called &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Chick-Ranch-Austin/697801683571177" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chick Ranch&lt;/a> and featured tons of live bands and BBQ from a Chicago restaurant called &lt;a href="http://www.lilliesq.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lillies&lt;/a>. I managed to snag invites to both events for myself and a ton of my friends through some Twitter magic. Besides those, I walked around to a ton of the open venues all across downtown Austin to catch music and eat/drink free stuff.

I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to attend the past two years (since I&amp;rsquo;ve been in Austin) and it has always been a blast. Last year I had a ton of fun assisting with the Sunday food preparation so I was anxious to help again this year.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Colorado Summer</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/colorado-summer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Aug 2012 23:33:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/colorado-summer/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently visited Estes Park, Colorado where my dad has moved/semi-retired and took a ton of pictures since it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely beautiful up there. Here are a select few with &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shiruken/sets/72157631087676880/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many more available&lt;/a> on my Flickr account. Sadly there was almost no snow in the park, which is apparently very unusual (thanks a lot global warming). Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to visit again around Christmas so there should be plenty of that annoying white precipitation on the ground.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
