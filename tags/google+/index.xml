It offered a way to group posts by topic so that others could follow their specific interests rather than &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/&amp;#43;ColinSullender" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your entire profile&lt;/a>. I created two collections, &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/collection/MX98P" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data is Beautiful&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/collection/A2NSc" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Science GIFs&lt;/a>, the latter of which I&amp;rsquo;ve maintained for almost three years now. Every week I post a science-related GIF and an accompanying explanation of the finding, physical phenomenon, or chemical reaction. I try to feature recent research publications and announcements whenever possible to avoid reposting content seen elsewhere online.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
