I wanted to create more minimalistic images rather than the extremely busy/stylized images other contestants were presenting. I also wanted to steer away from the Comic Sans MS and Doge-speak in favor of a more serious look. The resulting images are displayed below along with a Facebook demo and anyone is welcome to use them on Facebook (or elsewhere) to show their support for Dogecoin.</description></item><item><title>Dogecoin Halving Countdown</title><link>https://csullender.com/posts/dogecoin-halving-countdown/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2014 02:07:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://csullender.com/posts/dogecoin-halving-countdown/</guid><description>The first block reward halving for Dogecoin resulted in many Reddit users asking when the event was occurring and how much the new block reward would be.

Promoters of this cryptocurrency have been extremely vocal about the carefree attitude surrounding Dogecoin and actively encourage giving freely to others (tipping) in order to raise awareness.</description></item></channel></rss>
