It&amp;rsquo;s been just over three months since I started tracking my daily steps and most of my sleep. While I haven&amp;rsquo;t started running yet (I promise I&amp;rsquo;ll start eventually), it&amp;rsquo;s been fascinating to see my walking activity tracked throughout the day. One of my biggest complaints about Fitbit&amp;rsquo;s services is that they make you pay to access in-depth information about your activity. I think that it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely ludicrous to charge $49.99 a year to see the full extent of your data. With that said, they do offer an API for third-party development with access to the raw data (steps, distance, etc.) so I used this to &lt;a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2013/02/how-to-download-fitbit-data-using-google-spreadsheets/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automatically pull&lt;/a> my daily activity into a Google Drive spreadsheet for easy access and analysis. Using this data, I generate my &lt;a href="http://www.csullender.com/health/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;health tracking&amp;rdquo; page&lt;/a> featuring several charts of my ongoing Fitbit activity. The remainder of this post presents a summary of my Fitbit activity over the past 90 days since I got the One.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
